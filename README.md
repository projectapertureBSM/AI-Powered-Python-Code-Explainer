Project Title: AI-Powered Python Code Explainer
Project Description
This repository provides an AI-powered Python Code Explainer that uses state-of-the-art models from OpenAI GPT and Hugging Face Transformers to generate detailed and simple explanations for Python code snippets. This tool allows developers, students, and coding enthusiasts to understand complex Python code by providing natural language explanations step by step.

The tool has two modes of operation:

OpenAI GPT-4 Powered Mode: Leverages OpenAI’s GPT API to provide precise and in-depth explanations.
Hugging Face Transformers Mode: Uses the Hugging Face Salesforce/codexglue-code-to-text model as a free alternative for code summarization.
Features
Accepts Python code snippets as input.
Provides a detailed, human-readable explanation of the code.
Two AI-powered explanation modes:
GPT-4 for high-quality results (requires OpenAI API Key).
Hugging Face Transformers for an open-source alternative.
Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
Flow of the Project
Install Dependencies:

Ensure required libraries (openai, transformers) are installed.
Input Python Code:

The user provides a Python code snippet as input through the command-line interface.
Process Code:

The program processes the input using one of two models:
GPT-4 Mode: Calls the OpenAI GPT-4 API with the code snippet and retrieves a detailed explanation.
Hugging Face Mode: Uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face to generate the explanation.
Output Explanation:

The explanation is returned and displayed in the terminal.
Interactive Mode:

The tool continuously runs until the user types exit.

How to Run
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-python-code-explainer.git
cd ai-python-code-explainer
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook or Script:

Open the Jupyter notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook AI-powered_code_explainer.ipynb
Alternatively, run the script directly:
bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Provide Input Code:

Paste your Python code snippet when prompted.
Choose the mode of explanation (OpenAI GPT-4 or Hugging Face).

Working Example
Input:

python
Copy code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
Output (GPT-4 Mode):

This code defines a function named add that takes two arguments, a and b.
The function adds the two numbers and returns the result.
Output (Hugging Face Mode):

The function add adds two numbers a and b and returns their sum.
